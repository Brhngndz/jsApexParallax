      <h2>Apex Shared Abilities </h2>
      <p>
        Each Legend is defined by their unique Tactical ability, Passive ability, and Ultimate ability, the following abilities however are shared across the board, although some Legends may enhance one or more of these:
        <ul>
          <li>Each Legend is part of a class, which are categorized between <b> Offensive, Defensive,  Recon and Support.</b></li>
          <li>Legends can walk, sprint, jump, crouch, crouch walk, slide, mantle, and climb walls up to 5-6 meters tall;
            Through the use of their jump kits, Legends can skydive from high altitudes, boost themselves along zip lines, and negate fall damage;</li>
          <li>Legends can equip up to two<b> firearms</b> and one of each kind of<b> gear</b>;
            Legends have 10 inventory slots that can be used to carry<b> ammo, ordnance, regen</b> items, and spare attachments;</li>
          <li>Legends can perform melee attacks at any time, which slightly knock back the enemy while also dealing damage;</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Hitboxes</h2>
      <p>
        Legends come in three different sizes:<b> large, medium, and small</b>. Though each Legend's hitbox is a bit different, in general, Legends of the same size use the same hitbox "rig" in which their hitboxes are based off of. This means that<b> Caustic's</b> hitbox is the same size as<b> Gibraltar's, Mirage's </b>hitbox is the same size as<b> Bangalore's, Octane's, Crypto's</b>, etc. and <b>Bloodhound</b> has the same head hitbox as all the other medium Legends, despite their head looking bigger. Because hitbox sizes significantly impact gameplay,<b> Fortified and  Low Profile</b> were added in an attempt to even the playing field. In Season Season 9, Low Profile was removed, causing the small Legends to receive boosts in win rate thanks to them being objectively smaller than other Legends with nothing to counteract it. In response, efforts were made to bring hitboxes closer together.
